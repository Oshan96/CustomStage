## Projects using CustomStage

## Overview
This CustomStage is a JavaFX undecorated Stage. To put it simple, CustomStage is a Window and you can add different views (FXML files)
to the window (like changing the scene of the window) as you prefer.
The basic problem making the Stage "Undecorated" is that you will not be able to,
  1) Resize the window using mouse.
  2) Lose the default action buttons.
  3) Move the window (by dragging) (etc.)

So, CustomStage will get rid of all of these issues since it includes,
  1) Window resizing (the ResizeHelper class is used here with minor modifications) -> [ResizeHelper class](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19455059/allow-user-to-resize-an-undecorated-stage)
  2) Default action buttons and their behaviour (close, maximize/restore, minimize)
  3) Window dragging 
  

### What else?

- Window is **_automatically scaled_** as for screen resolution
- Very **_responsive_**
- Apart from those, this is called **CustomStage** since it **_can be customized as you wish_**

#### How?

- Easy. You can get your customized Stage using the [**CustomStageBuilder**](src/main/java/lk/vivoxalabs/customstage/CustomStageBuilder.java) class. 
  This class includes all the methods you will need to customize your window.
